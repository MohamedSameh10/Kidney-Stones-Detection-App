# Kidney-Stones-Detection-App

Kidney stones (also called renal calculi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys. Kidney stones vary in density, but most are composed of substances like calcium oxalate (and sometimes calcium phosphate). These mineral components have a high density, resulting in their bright appearance on the scan.

* Developed a web application utilizing Streamlit framework to analyze medical images and detect kidney stones.
* Trained a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model on a dataset comprising medical images of kidney stones to achieve accurate detection.
* Used openCV to outline the detected kidney stones.
